1. Check slack's jc_reprise channel. Implement metapop model in python and run dynamics to check if the whitboard claim is true. For what value of c? For rock-paper-siccors P matrix. 
2. Finish getting the equilibria of equations once they have been transformed to a zero-sum game. 
3. Check the general way of transforming any 2x2 game into a partnership/zero-sum game. 
4. Compute equilibrium, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors of the zero-sum game.5. Get Jacobian at equilibrium, and calculate eigenvalues. Check for local stability.
6. Perform simulations under the right conditions to show coexistence, but also its lack of robustness.

Sometimes I obtain coexistance of more than 2 soil or plants when sampling A at random. is this a mistake of implementation, or that the coexistence conditions are being met by chance? Check this.
